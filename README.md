# Hackintosh High Sierra 10.13.6 EFI

This is an EFI-only booter for High Sierra 10.13.6, which does not include an OS or installer/repairer (it is FAT32). The system specifications are as follows:

    CPU: Intel Core i5-8400 (Coffee Lake)
    GPU: MSI GeForce GTX 1050 Ti OC 4GT (NVidia)
    STORAGE: 1 FLASH (LIKE SSD) with this booter and MacOS
    ETHERNET: Realtek RTL8111
    AUDIO: Realtek ALC887

## Features
Everything works except for FaceTime and iMessages. Keep in mind that many apps, especially those from the App Store, require a newer OS version. Also please note that this is the last version of MacOS with NVidia drivers supporting Metal.

## Installation
I highly recommend installing this booter on an external device, like a USB drive, as it can cause issues when installed on your PC's main drive. Please note that I have only tested this with Windows 11 and I have encountered issues with bluescreens when updating and rebooting with the connected booter.

## Disclaimer
This EFI is intended to work with given specifications. Please note that installing and using this EFI booter is at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage or data loss that may occur.
