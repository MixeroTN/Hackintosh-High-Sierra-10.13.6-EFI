# Hackintosh-High-Sierra-10.13.6-EFI
High Sierra 10.13.6

EFI only - no OS and no installer/repairer included (this is FAT32).


CPU: Intel Core i5-8400 (Coffee Lake)
GPU: MSI GeForce GTX 1050 Ti OC 4GT (NVidia)
STORAGE: 1 FLASH (LIKE SSD) with this booter and MacOS
ETHERNET: Realtek RTL8111
AUDIO: Realtek ALC887


Everything works except FaceTime and iMessages. Many of apps (expecially from AppStore) requires a newer OS version - keep that in mind.
I recommend to do it on external device like me - my main PC OS is Windows 11 and the bluescreen pops up while update rebooting with connected booter, 
so I highly disrecommend to install this booter on your PC drive.
