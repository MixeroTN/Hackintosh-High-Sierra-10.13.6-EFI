## Features
Everything works except for FaceTime and iMessages. Keep in mind that many apps, especially those from the App Store, require a newer OS version. Also please note that this is the last version of MacOS with NVidia drivers supporting Metal.

## Installation
I highly recommend installing this booter on an external device, like a USB drive, as it can cause issues when installed on your PC's main drive. Please note that I have only tested this with Windows 11 and I have encountered issues with bluescreens when updating and rebooting with the connected booter.

## Disclaimer
This EFI is intended to work with given specifications. Please note that installing and using this EFI booter is at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage or data loss that may occur.
